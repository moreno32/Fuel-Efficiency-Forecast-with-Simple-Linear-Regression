# Fuel Efficiency Forecast with Simple Linear Regression

## 🔄 Overview:
In this project, you will build a simple linear regression model to predict fuel consumption of light-duty vehicles in Canada. Fuel consumption is an important aspect to consider when buying a new car and having an accurate prediction can help consumers make informed decisions. The project will use the FuelConsumption.csv dataset to train, test, and evaluate the model. You will use libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, scikit-learn, scipy, and itertools to import, process, and visualize the data.

## 🎊 Motivation:
The aim of this project is to explore the relationship between various features and fuel consumption of light-duty vehicles in Canada. The project provides an opportunity to apply basic regression techniques, build a model, and make predictions on real-world data. Furthermore, it helps to understand the significance of different factors that impact fuel consumption and how they can be used to make informed decisions.

## 🏁 Learning Objectives:
1)	Import, process and explore the FuelConsumption.csv dataset.
2)	Build a simple linear regression model to predict fuel consumption.
3)	Evaluate the performance of the model and identify areas for improvement.
4)	Apply data visualization techniques to understand the relationships between features and fuel consumption.

## ⚙️ Technical Aspects:
In this project, you will apply basic regression techniques and use libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, scikit-learn, and scipy to build and evaluate the model. The model will be built using the simple linear regression method, where a single independent variable is used to predict the dependent variable (fuel consumption).

## 🧰 Technology used:
The project will use:
1)	Pandas for data preprocessing and manipulation.
2)	Matplotlib, Numpy, Seaborn for data visualization.
3)	Scikit-learn for building and evaluating the regression model.
4)	Scipy for statistical analysis.

## 📚 Data Source:
The project will use the FuelConsumption.csv dataset, which contains fuel consumption ratings and estimated carbon dioxide emissions for new light-duty vehicles for retail sale in Canada. The dataset was obtained from the Government of Canada.

## 🗂️ Project Structure:
The project will consist of the following stages.
1)	Importing necessary libraries and packages.
2)	Downloading the FuelConsumption.csv dataset.
3)	Understanding the data structure and content.
4)	Preprocessing and cleaning the data.
5)	Building the simple linear regression model.
6)	Training and evaluating the model.
7)	Visualizing the results.

## 👥 Credits:
The FuelConsumption.csv dataset was obtained from the Government of Canada.
